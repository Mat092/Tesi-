# Tesi-

In this repository I put the code of my Thesis work for the Bachelor Degree in Physics. 
I exploited a Genetic Algorithm to evolve the structure of a trained Fully Connected Neural Network. 
For further information check my repository [Tesi_Latex](https://github.com/Mat092/Tesi_latex), where I explain in details the algorithms, the datasets and the results obtained.
